Server for the Forged Cavalier Game.

Install:
--------
cd into server and run:
  npm install

Everything in the public directory can be server with express, which by default
server index.html automatically.

Progress:
---------
So far, you can start up the server with:
  node server/app.js
Open a browser on localhost:8080. The first person logging in will be assigned
as the Cavalier. The next 3 people logging in will be assigned as Warriors. Any
more users logging in will get a message saying that there are no free spots.
If any of the users logs out (close the tab), all others get a message saying
that the connection was lost and the game has ended. They can log in again.
